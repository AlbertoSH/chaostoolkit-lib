    A chaos experiment consists of a method made of activities to carry
    sequentially.

    There are two kinds of activities:

    * probe: detecting the state of a resource in your system or external to it
      There are two kinds of probes: `steady` and `close`
    * action: an operation to apply against your system

    Usually, an experiment is made of a set of `steady` probes that ensure the
    system is sound to carry further the experiment. Then, an action before
    another set of of  Ì€close` probes to sense the state of the system
    post-action.

    This function raises :exc:`InvalidExperiment`, :exc:`InvalidProbe` or
    :exc:`InvalidAction` depending on where it fails.
